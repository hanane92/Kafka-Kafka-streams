Bindings — a collection of interfaces that identify the input and output channels declaratively
Binder — messaging-middleware implementation such as Kafka or RabbitMQ
Channel — represents the communication pipe between messaging-middleware[broker/kafka] and the application
StreamListeners — message-handling methods in beans that will be automatically invoked on a message from the channel
 after the MessageConverter does the serialization/deserialization between middleware-specific events and domain
 object types / POJOs

Message Schemas — used for serialization and deserialization of messages, these schemas can be statically read from
 a location or loaded dynamically, supporting the evolution of domain object types
